# 343-HW1

Some commands provided by git which I will likely use often include:

git add <filename> to add a file to the "staging enviornment to be committed
git commit -m "message" to commit code with a message describing what it contains
git checkout -b <branchName> to create a new branch off the current state of the project
git push origin branchName to push a branch to gitHub
git pull origin master to pull the state of the master branch on gitHub to the local machine
